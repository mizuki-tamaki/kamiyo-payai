# SHIFT 1 HANDOFF

**Agent Type:** Infrastructure
**Start Time:** 2025-10-10 20:28:09 UTC
**End Time:** TBD
**Agent Name:** Claude Code Agent

---

## TASKS COMPLETED ✅

1. **Shift initialization and environment assessment**
   - ✅ Started Shift 1 (Infrastructure Agent)
   - ✅ Read priority tasks from PRIORITY_TASKS.md
   - ✅ Assessed current database state
   - ✅ Verified API running on port 3001
   - Files reviewed: prisma/schema.prisma, .env.example, docker-compose files

2. **Current production environment discovered:**
   - Database: **SQLite** at `/Users/dennisgoslar/Projekter/kamiyo/data/kamiyo.db` (420KB)
   - Data: 426 exploits, 55 chains, 5 active sources
   - API: Running and healthy (localhost:3001/api/health)
   - Schema: Already configured for PostgreSQL (provider = "postgresql")
   - Environment files: .env, docker-compose.production.yml exist

---

## TASKS IN PROGRESS ⏳

1. **PostgreSQL Deployment Assessment** (Currently paused for safety)
   - Status: CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED
   - Current: Live production site with real customer data in SQLite
   - Target: Migrate to PostgreSQL without data loss
   - Risk Level: HIGH - 426 exploits must be migrated safely

---

## BLOCKERS ⚠️

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: PostgreSQL Deployment Requires User Approval

**Issue:** This is a LIVE PRODUCTION SITE serving real paying customers.

**Current State:**
- Database: SQLite with 426 exploits
- Schema: Configured for PostgreSQL but not deployed
- Docker: Not currently running (Docker not found on system)
- Migration script: Exists at `scripts/migrate_to_postgres.py`

**Recommended Approach:**
1. User confirms PostgreSQL deployment strategy
2. Set up PostgreSQL (local or Docker)
3. Run migration script to transfer data
4. Test thoroughly before switching
5. Update DATABASE_URL in .env
6. Restart services

**Why Blocked:**
- Cannot deploy PostgreSQL without confirmation on live production site
- Need to know: Local PostgreSQL vs Docker vs Remote?
- Need backup confirmation before migration
- Customer data at risk if migration fails

**Question for User:**
How should PostgreSQL be deployed for this production site?
- A) Local PostgreSQL installation
- B) Docker Compose (requires Docker setup)
- C) Remote PostgreSQL (Render, AWS RDS, etc.)
- D) Skip for now (continue with SQLite)
